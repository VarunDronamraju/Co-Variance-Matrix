# Co-Variance-Matrix


1. *Function Definition*: 
   - We define a function named covariance that takes two lists, x and y, as input parameters. This function calculates the covariance between these two lists.

2. *Length Check*:
   - Before proceeding with the calculation, the function checks if the lengths of the input lists x and y are equal. If they are not equal, it returns None, indicating that the covariance cannot be calculated.

3. *Mean Calculation*:
   - Inside the function, it calculates the mean of each list x and y using the formula:
     \[
     \text{mean} = \frac{\text{sum of all elements}}{\text{number of elements}}
     \]
   - This is done using the sum() function to calculate the sum of all elements and dividing it by the length of the list.

4. *Covariance Calculation*:
   - Once the mean values of x and y are calculated, the function computes the covariance using the formula:
     \[
     \text{covar}(x, y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \text{mean}_x) \times (y_i - \text{mean}_y)}{n}
     \]
   - It iterates over each element in the lists, subtracts the mean value, multiplies the differences, and sums up the results.
   - Finally, it divides the sum by the number of elements n to obtain the covariance.

5. *Return Value*:
   - The function returns the calculated covariance value.

6. *Example Usage*:
   - An example usage is provided at the end to demonstrate how to use the covariance function with sample lists x and y.
   - You can customize these lists with your own data to compute the covariance for your specific dataset.
